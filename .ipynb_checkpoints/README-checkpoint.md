## Business Category Popularity vs. Customer Ratings

## Overview
This project explores how business category popularity relates to customer ratings, driven by my interest in both data visualization and how businesses are perceived by customers. I was especially drawn to how visualization design can influence interpretation, so rather than just analyzing the data, I focused on experimenting with visual encodings to understand how design choices shape which business insights stand out.

## Research Question
**What factors are associated with higher customer ratings for businesses, and how does category popularity influence perceived quality?**

## What This Project Does
Using a business review dataset, the notebook:

- Analyzes the relationship between **business category popularity** and **average customer ratings**
- Uses multiple visualization strategies to surface patterns and comparisons
- Applies different **encoding techniques** (color, symbols, filtering) to improve clarity and interpretability
- Evaluates how visualization choices can emphasize or obscure trends

## Visualizations & Analysis
The notebook includes:

- **Three labeled visualizations**, each using a different design approach  
- **Clear captions** explaining what each visualization shows and why specific encodings were chosen  
- A **final reflection and conclusion** summarizing key insights and design takeaways  

## Key Takeaways
- Category popularity and customer ratings are related, but not perfectly aligned  
- Visualization design choices significantly impact how trends are perceived  
- Thoughtful use of color, symbols, and filtering improves interpretability without overwhelming the viewer
